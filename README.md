This is to make you install Access Noxim in your system. 
One thing is to be noted that this is exclusively for linux Ubuntu platform. May be it can work on other linux system.

We need system C to use Access Noxim. The version used is for version 0.3 of Access Noxim.
Individual folder in Full Setup contains the Individual readme for helping you in installation.
1st install system C and then Noxim
